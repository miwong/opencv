Parallelization of Face Detection in Software

This is the code for a project in ECE1747 Parallel Programming.  Various parallelization and optimization techniques were employed to improve performance for the Viola-Jones face detection algorithm.  These changes are meant to be used with the corresponding changes in the MEVBench repository (MEVBench is a computer vision benchmark suite designed for mobile devices).

Implemented optimizations include:
- Pipelining
- Loop parallellization (synchronized and scheduled using a ticket-like scheme)
- Cache tiling
